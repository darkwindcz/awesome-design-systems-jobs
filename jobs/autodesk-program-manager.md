## Position Overview  
  
Reporting to the Chief of Staff, Digital Platform and Experience XD, the Design System Program Manager is responsible for organizing and enabling a team to deliver an expansion of the Autodesk Human Interface Guidelines design system to new touch points in the digital platform ecosystem, including Autodesk.com and global sites; Autodesk Knowledge Network; Autodesk Account portal and other properties. This role requires a rare combination of top-notch execution, brilliant collaboration skills, and a passion for design systems.  
  
You will develop and oversee execution of the program to align design standards for the digital platform, from basics such as color, typography and responsive grid, to components like buttons and menus, to complex patterns such as lists and forms. The program will incorporate four major activities: definition of standards; execution of standards; adoption of standards by various touch points in production; operationalization of the program for ongoing maintenance, expansion and adoption of the system.  
  
The role requires a comfort level with highly cross functional programs, bringing together a diverse team, providing them with clear direction and priorities, and seeing the program through to success.  
  
## Our Team  
  
The Digital Platform and Experience (DPE) organization is tasked with creating a best-in-class self-service experience for customers as they evaluate, try, and buy our products; manage their accounts, profiles, and relationships with Autodesk; begin to use the products; and deepen their mastery of the products over time. DPE is also responsible for creating self-service tools to automate internal processes. The Experience Design (XD) team within DPE includes interaction design, visual design, research, and content strategy.  
  
## Responsibilities  

-   Developing an understanding of the complex ecosystem of digital platform touch points, stakeholders, design, product management and engineering teams  
-   Working with stakeholders to define clear objectives, priorities and opportunities for the design system  
-   Developing a program for the definition, alignment, execution, and adoption of the design system  
-   Delivering stakeholder and management alignment to the program and priorities  
-   Organizing, enabling, and holding accountable dedicated and shared teammates across design and development functions to deliver the design system  
-   Developing a process and workflow for the maintenance, expansion and adoption of an operationalized design system  
-   Developing a communication plan to ensure awareness of status and accomplishments to the team, stakeholders, and management
